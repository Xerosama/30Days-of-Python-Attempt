I am attempting the 30 Days of Python challenge made by Asabeneh to learn python. If you also want to try it, search Asabeneh 30 Days of Python on github, if you search without 'Asabeneh' keyword, you will dozens of other repositories with similar names which are attempts by different people at the same challenge, so to find the challenge itself you must use 'Asabeneh' as a search keyword. I am grateful to him for making this course content free for all.
